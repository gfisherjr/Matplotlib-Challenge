Three Observations:

Out of all the regimens, there seems to be two in particular that have the most promising results for decreasing the size of tumors: Ramicane and Capomulin. 

1. In the first bar chart, we can see that the data points indicate a larger data sample collected for the two regimes Ramicane and Capomulin. Not only do we have more data points for the two, but the box plots indicate a much smaller final tumor volume size even compared to the other two leading regimens, Ceftamin and Infubinol. We can assume that the first two regimens have the highest probability of success given the lowest rates of tumor size, and that there were more data points collected due to the regimen's successes. 

2. The tests were completed with an almost perfect 50% / 50% split between males and females, so we can conclude that gender has no bias effect on the regimens being tested. The split of males vs females are represented in the pie charts: 50.6% male and 49.4% female.

3. After calculating a linnear regression for the Capomulin regimen, the slope would indicate that the mouse's tumor volume vs its average weight has a one to one ratio; if the mouse's weight decreases by 1 (g), then the averge tumor volume also deacreases by 1 (mm3). This could be useful when determining the effectiveness for future tests on mice vs the expected outcome, and give a relieble source for comparrison. The linnear regression also allows us to conclude that the data being tested is a good and fair data set to test, with a r-value of 0.84 and a r-squared value of 0.71.
